# Welcome!

I'm **Boden Moraski**, a high school researcher and entrepreneur focused on building AI tools that help people learn better, think more deeply, and flourish in mind, body, and spirit—while studying the philosophical implications of the technologies shaping our future.

## Current Work

Right now I'm primarily interested in [AI Safety](https://www.anthropic.com/news/core-views-on-ai-safety), especially [scalable oversight](https://bluedot.org/blog/scalable-oversight-intro), [risk and capabilities benchmarking](https://ai-safety-atlas.com/chapters/05), and [prosaic alignment](https://aisafety.info/questions/89LM/What-is-prosaic-alignment). I also believe that governance, advocacy, and community-building in AI Safety are all crucial to support and complement these research directions.

I'm also interested in [ethical frameworks](https://aese.psu.edu/teachag/curriculum/modules/bioethics-1/what-are-ethical-frameworks) and how they interact and arise in both biological and artificial systems. I personally tend to operate through an ever-evolving amalgam of [Virtue Ethics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/), [Rationalism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism), [Confucianism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/confucius), and Utilitarianism, predominantly in the context of [Longtermism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/longtermism).

**AI Ethical Compass** — Creating a platform that uses scenario-based learning to help educators teach responsible AI use. Featured project in the Intel + ISTE AI Innovators Challenge, with pilot programs launching in schools.

**SPIG Technologies** — Built the only publicly available grading platform with real-time group grading. Piloting in U.S. schools with interest from 10+ districts after being showcased at the 2024 National AP Convention.

**CMU Philosophy & CS Research** — Contributing to "Sway," an AI-guided dialogue platform that pairs students with opposing views to foster civil discourse within ethical constraints, reaching 10k+ users worldwide.

**National AI Education Curriculum** — Collaborating with AI4K12 to design national high school AI education curriculum.

## Research Focus

My independent research explores moral alignment in large language models, specifically how chain-of-thought prompting affects ethical reasoning. I'm also developing quantum algorithms and optimization techniques, with work published and recognized at regional science fairs.

## Recognition

Recent highlights include winning Pennsylvania's Congressional App Challenge, placing 1st in state FBLA Data Analysis, and being selected as a HouseOfCode Lightning Talk speaker at the Capitol. I'm also a research fellow with Frontlines Foundation and was selected for the PAIR Program in the UK.

## Get In Touch

I'm always interested in connecting with fellow researchers, builders, and anyone passionate about the intersection of AI, ethics, and education.
